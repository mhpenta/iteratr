Task "Iteration Loop - Handle iteration limits" was already completed in a previous iteration. The orchestrator.go:121-125 correctly checks cfg.Iterations > 0 (for finite limits) and iterationCount >= cfg.Iterations (to enforce the limit). When limit is reached, it prints a message and breaks the loop. The logic is sound: for cfg.Iterations=3, it runs exactly 3 iterations (iterationCount goes 0->1->2, then breaks at 3).

Task "Iteration Loop - Continue from last iteration" was already completed in a previous iteration. The orchestrator.go:102-108 loads session state and calculates startIteration = len(state.Iterations) + 1, which correctly resumes from the last iteration. For a new session, startIteration=1; for a session with 5 iterations, startIteration=6. The State struct tracks iterations in the Iterations slice.
